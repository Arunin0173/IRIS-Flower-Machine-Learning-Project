# IRIS-Flower-Machine-Learning-Project

To write a detailed README for your Iris machine learning project, it should cover all key aspects from setup to execution. Here's an example structure for the README file:

Iris Machine Learning Project
Project Overview
This project uses the Iris dataset to implement a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building using various machine learning algorithms.

Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset used for pattern recognition. It consists of 150 observations with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and one target column (species of the flower).

Data Preprocessing
Loading the dataset: The dataset is loaded using pandas.
Handling missing values: The dataset does not contain missing values, so this step is skipped.
Feature selection: All four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) are used for model building.
Splitting the dataset: The data is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = iris_df.drop('species', axis=1)
y = iris_df['species']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis includes:

Visualizing pair plots to observe relationships between features.
Box plots and histograms to understand the distribution of data.
Correlation heatmap to show the correlation between features.
Key findings from the EDA:

Sepal length and petal length have a strong positive correlation.
Different species show distinguishable patterns in the pair plot.
Model Building
Several machine learning algorithms were tested to classify iris species:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Each model was evaluated based on accuracy, and hyperparameters were tuned using grid search or cross-validation.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
Confusion Matrix: Provides insights into the performance of the classification.
Precision, Recall, and F1-score: Used for more detailed evaluation.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Results
Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 95%.
Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 97%, making it the best-performing model.
The confusion matrix showed that most misclassifications occurred between versicolor and virginica.
